#' sketchR - an R interface for python subsampling/sketching algorithms
#'
#' The sketchR package provides an R interface for various subsampling
#' algorithms implemented in python packages. Currently, interfaces to the
#' geosketch and scSampler python packages are implemented, in the functions
#' geosketch() and scsampler(), respectively. In addition the package also
#' provides diagnostic plots to evaluate the subsampling.
#' More details on how to get started and incorporate the subsampling into
#' an scRNA-seq workflow are provided in the vignette.
